 As the frequency increases the inductor will block more of the AC signal.,Also we saw that the inductors current continues to rise until it reaches its maximum steady state condition after five time constants. The maximum current flowing through an inductive coil is limited only by the resistive part of the coils windings in Ohms and as we know from Ohms law this is determined by the ratio of voltage over current V/R.When an alternating or AC voltage is applied across an inductor the flow of current through it behaves very differently to that of an applied DC voltage. The effect of a sinusoidal supply produces a phase difference between the voltage and the current waveforms. Now in an AC circuit the opposition to current flow through the coils windings not only depends upon the inductance of the coil but also the frequency of the AC waveform.The opposition to current flowing through a coil in an AC circuit is determined by the AC resistance more commonly known as Impedance (Z) of the circuit. But resistance is always associated with DC circuits so to distinguish DC resistance from AC resistance the term Reactance is generally used.Just like resistance the value of reactance is also measured in Ohms but is given the symbol X (uppercase letter X) to distinguish it from a purely resistive value.As the component we are interested in is an inductor the reactance of an inductor is therefore called Inductive Reactance. In other words an inductors electrical resistance when used in an AC circuit is called Inductive Reactance.Inductive Reactance which is given the symbol XL is the property in an AC circuit which opposes the change in the current. In our tutorials about Capacitors in AC Circuits we saw that in a purely capacitive circuit the current IC LEADS the voltage by 90o. In a purely inductive AC circuit the exact opposite is true the current IL LAGS the applied voltage by 90o or (?/2 rads).,2,4,1,33,  How does an inductor respond to changes in frequency of the input signal?,34,KC
